# Stipple Image Generator App with GUI using Weighted Voronoi Stippling

**Weighted Voronoi Stippling** application with custom `customtkinter` GUI allows users to select an image, set stippling parameters, generate weighted Voronoi stippling diagrams, and save GIF of centroid evolution

## üåü **Features**

- **File Selection**:
  - Supports different dimmensions
  - Supports different image types (Gray, Color etc)
  - file types:
    - `.png`
    - `.jpg`
    - `.jpeg`
    - `.bmp`
- **Plot Outputs**:
  - Produce weighted Voronoi diagram based on input image and paramerters
  - Produce stipple image based on the weighted Voronoi and input paramerters
- **Evolution GIF**:
  - Saves every iteration of image generation as a seemless GIF file showcasing centroid evolution
- **Quantization Levels**:
  - Can reduce the number of gray value outputs that are being used during computiation
- **Two Voronoi Region Centroid Computation Methods**:
  - Random sampling (Recommended):
    - Uses random sample of  `(max_x - min_x) * (max_y - min_y) * 10` size to find contained pixels, and uses those to compute gray value density centroid
    - Relativly faster Iterations
    - Introduces jitter, which is able to dislodge points that were previously stuck in an un-optimal space
  - Original Lloyd's Method:
    - Uses all pixels within region to compute gray value density centroid
    - Need fewer iterations to get to final Voronoi points
    - Final Voronoi points may be unevenly concentrated and result in some areas containing dense clusters of stuck points
- **Continuous Progression Report**:
  - Console logs updates after completion on each iteration and major code segment

## üéì **Instructions**

1. **Start Application:**
   - For windows, simply download and run `Weighted Voronoi Stippling.exe` executable
   - Otherwise download all `.py` files and use python to run `Voronoi_Gui.py`

2. **Select Image File:**:
   - Click `Browse` button and select an image file in your directory
     - ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/36764f16-38ac-418d-82d8-6efdee54c2d5)
   - Image preview should be available once selected
     - ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df5c0541-a57f-41a7-9ee0-fb20aaf98d8c)

6. **Output Figures:**
   - If the plot parameters are selected then the application should output three windows containing:
     - Final Voronoi Diagram with tessellations
     - Final Stipple Image
     - Original Image for reference
   - ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/306ef6c9-e086-4d27-a54f-3944b0ea99f9)
7. **Saved Evolution GIF:**
   - If the `Save` checkbox parameter is checked, the final saved evolution gif can be found in the same directory as `Weighted Voronoi Stippling.exe`/`Voronoi_Gui.py`
